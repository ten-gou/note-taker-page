## 1. Description
A web based note taking program, which writes to the database and which you can add or delete from.

Warnings: A known bug is that the notes do not update on the first go around. Updating the page via refreshing the page, or saving/deleting another note will show the update that was supposed to appear. I know where the issue is, but I don't know how to fix it yet.
